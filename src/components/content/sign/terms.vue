    <p class="terms-title">Come into force: September 6th, 2018.</p>
    <p>LORDLESS is a decentralized task distribution platform with game as carrier, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own and exchange genetically unique LORDLESS Taverns (the “Taverns,”) which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”).  The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their Taverns and to acquire and trade Taverns with other App users via clock auction.</p>
    <p>LORDLESS ("lordless.io", "we", or "us") is making the App available to you. If you are accepting this Agreement and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement. By accessing our Service, you agree that you have read, understood and accepted this Agreement.</p>
    <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.</p>
    <strong>1. Taverns</strong>
    <p>Users have choices about the data the Company collect. When users is asked to provide personal data, users may decline. But if users choose not to provide data that is necessary to enable The Company to make the Game available to users, users may not be able to sign up for or play the Game. The data the Company collected depends on the context of the users' interactions with Game, and the choices users make (including users' privacy settings). The data the Company collected can include the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>We have utilized the Smart Contracts on Ethereum and the Site to create Taverns. These Taverns are defined on the Smart Contracts in such a way as any user can see any and all total amount of reserves of all Taverns and reserves of each Taverns, and other logics relating to user’s task activities. We have an intention to invite all users to enjoy completing quests in Taverns under transparent conditions. However, we always monitor Characters’ image data and part of other information on and through our servers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each user can exchange the Taverns owned by such user with any other user(s) under the terms and conditions as designated by such user by and through the Smart Contract within the App. Upon the conclusion of a Taverns exchange arrangement, any user may not return any exchanged Taverns for any reason.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2. For Using the App</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser or Firefox browser. Once you have installed them, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third-party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The App will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact directly with the App.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome or Firefox, the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at @LORDLESS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>3. Fees and Payment</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you elect to exchange Tavern(s) with or from other users via the App, any transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you elect to exchange Tavern(s) with or from other users via the App, any transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>4. Ownership; Restrictions; Grant of License</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to all elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein.

For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (i) that your “acquire” of a Tavern, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with that Taverns) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; and (ii) that  do not have the right to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with that LORDLESS) in any way without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>5. Termination</strong>
    <p>You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the App. You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have under any applicable law or regulation. Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party. Sections 2.C and 3 through 16 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.</p>
    <strong>6. Disclaimers</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND ANY PART OF IT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SITE, ANY SMART CONTRACT, OR ANY EXTERNAL WEBSITES), INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (A) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (B) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE APP, ETHEREUM NETWORK, OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LORDLESS TAVERNS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE ETHEREUM NETWORK. ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LORDLESS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS (a kind of a version up which makes a split of the blockchain into two chains without compatibility), TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>7. Limitation of Liability</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B) $100.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LORDLESS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS (a kind of a version up which makes a split of the blockchain into two chains without compatibility), TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO LIMIT DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CLAIMS AND/OR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>8. Assumption of Risk</strong>
    <p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your LORDLESS-related transactions. LORDLESS is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The App does not store, send, or receive Taverns. This is because Taverns exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of Taverns occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that LORDLESS will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the LORDLESS ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of LORDLESS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the LORDLESS ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of LORDLESS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard (ERC-20: a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain), including the LORDLESS ecosystem.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>9. Indemnification</strong>
    <p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify LORDLESS and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys’ fees arising out of or in any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the App, or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App. You agree that LORDLESS will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.</p>
    <strong>10. External Sites</strong>
    <p>The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.</p>
    <strong>11. Changes to the Terms</strong>
    <p>We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make changes, we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.</p>
    <strong>12. Children</strong>
    <p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING ALL FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.</p>
    <strong>13. Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <strong>14. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</strong>
    <p>Please read this Section carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with LORDLESS and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>
    <p>All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your access or use of the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, or to any products sold or distributed through the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its applicable rules. Each party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings; however, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration proceedings, LORDLESS will pay them for you.</p>
    <p>WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THE APP, THE SITE, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR ANY PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE APP, THE SITE, OR THE SMART CONTRACTS: (I) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY; AND (II) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</p>
    <strong>15. General</strong>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and LORDLESS, govern your access to and use of the App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties related to your access to or use of the App, whether oral or written. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger. Should any part of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. We will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations that result from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, Internet disturbances, or acts or omissions of third parties. You agree that we may provide you with notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email, regular mail, or postings on the App. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>
